My name is Uğur Çayoğlu and this is my blog. I studied Computer Science at
the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://www.kit.edu) and I am currently working
there as a postdoc in the [Steinbuch Centre of Computing (SCC)](https://scc.kit.edu).

If you find some the ideas I am describing here at my blog interesting I would
love to hear from you. You can get in touch w/ me via [GitHub](https://www.github.com/ucyo), [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/_ucyo_) or [E-Mail](mailto:ugur.cayoglu@gmail.com). 

Thank you for stopping by and have a great day!
